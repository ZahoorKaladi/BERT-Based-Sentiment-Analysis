# BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis

This project uses a pretrained BERT model for sentiment analysis, combined with a web-based user interface built with Streamlit. It also includes features such as Twitter API integration for real-time sentiment analysis on tweets and a web scraping tool to analyze sentiment from various online sources.

## Features

- **Pretrained BERT Model**: Utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for accurate sentiment classification.
- **Streamlit UI**: A simple and interactive user interface built using Streamlit for users to input text and see sentiment analysis results in real-time.
- **Twitter API Integration**: Fetch and analyze tweets related to a specific keyword or hashtag, displaying sentiment results for the Twitter data.
- **Web Scraping Tool**: Scrape websites and analyze the sentiment of textual content from online articles or reviews.
- **ML Sentiment Analysis**: Performs sentiment classification into categories such as Positive, Negative, and Neutral based on the input data.
